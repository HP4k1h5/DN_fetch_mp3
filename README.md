### This is an \*unofficial\*, \*unaffiliated\* command line tool to download and play the latest Democracy Now! broadcast as an .mp3 file. This tool should work on linux based systems or from any linux compatible terminal emulator.

#### Democracy Now! typically airs at 8:00 am EST Mon-Fri, and uploads the day's broadcast a little after 9:00 am EST. Therefore, if you try to download a show after midnight, it will look for yesterday's show. If you try to download a show during the weekend, it will look for friday's show.


###Latest Version: dn_fetch-mp3.sh

## INSTALLATION:

  1) clone or download this repository. 
  2) change the permissions on the latest version of the .sh file to allow -execute access
     on most linux systems type: "chmod +x dn_fetch-mp3.sh"
  3) run the script by typing "./dn_fetchmp3.sh" while you are in the project directory
     (if run from outside the parent directory, it will download the mp3 to that directory)
