This is an \*unofficial\*, \*unaffiliated\* command line tool to download and play the latest Democracy Now! broadcast as an .mp3 file. This tool should work on linux based systems or from any linux compatible terminal emulator.

This script is not pulling data from a public api, and is therefore not guaranteed to be stable. This repository is in no way associated with Democracy Now!

Democracy Now! typically airs at 8:00 am EST Mon-Fri, and uploads the day's broadcast a little after 9:00 am EST. Therefore, if you try to download a show after midnight, it will look for yesterday's show. If you try to download a show during the weekend, it will look for friday's show.

Latest Version: dn_fetchmp3.sh
